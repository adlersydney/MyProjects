# MyProjects

### In my repository, I have included some parts of programs that I have worked on in my Undergraduate degree from Lehigh University. For privacy purposes, I did not include any full programs - but instead snippets of projects that I feel represents my knowledge of C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java and Python.
