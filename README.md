### In my repository, I have included some parts of programs that I have worked on during my undergraduate degree from the P.C Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science at Lehigh University. 

### For privacy purposes, I did not include any full programs - but instead snippets of projects that I feel represents my knowledge of C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java and Python.

#### During my time on quaratine I have picked up creating websites for people, and have found myself learning new languages and expanding my knowledge.
