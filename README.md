# MyProjects

### In my repository, I have included files of programs that I have worked on during my Undergraduate degree in the P.C. Rossin School of Engineering and Applied Science at Lehigh University. For privacy purposes, I did not include any full programs - but instead snippets of projects that I feel represents my knowledge of C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java and Python. 

#### During quaratine I have been expanding my knowledge by learning some new programming languages and creating websites for people.
